# Algorithms-and-Data-Structures
Exercises form Algorithms and Data Structures course on the University of Technology in Wroc≈Çaw. READMEs in folders contain running instruction and my notes (still in polish, waiting to be translated).

### List 1
I implemented basic data structures.
- FIFO Queue
- One-way list
- Two-way cyclic list

### List 2
I implemented and tested five sorting algorithms.
- InsertSort
- MergeSort
- QuickSort
- DualQuickSort
- Hybrid insertsort i quickSort

### List 3
I implemented SELECT, RANDOMIZED_SELECT, binary_search and more advanced sorting algorithms.
- RadixSort
- Randomized select
- Select
- Binary search
- Enhanced  QuickSort
- Enhanced  DualQuickSort

### List 4
I implemented advanced data structures.
- Binary search tree
- Red-black tree
- Hashmap

### List 5
I implemented priority queue on binary heap, Dijikstra algorithm and algorithms used to find minimum spanning trees.
- Priority queue
- Binary heap
- Dijkstra algorithm
- Minimum spanning tree (MST)
	- Prim
	- Kruskal
